# Write a program calculating:

import datetime
import time
from datetime import date

# 1. How many hours are in a year?
print('There are ' + str(365*24) + ' hours in a regular year.')

# 2. How many minutes are in a decade?
print('There are ' + str((365*8+366*2)*24*60) + ' minutes in a decade (assuming two leap years).')

today = "Today\'s date: " + str(datetime.datetime.now())

print(today)
